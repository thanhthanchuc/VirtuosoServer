The country of Udor is a small country with a population of 1137135 blood elves
Bordered between mineral rich mountains to the North, a calm sea to the South, a huge forest to the East and a glacier to the West, the country of Udor mainly lives off animal training, jewelcrafting and tailoring.
Udor itself is mainly covered in woodlands and has a temperate climate, which has lead to a tightly concentrated population, despite the number of people, which means most of them live in huge settlements.
The country's landscape is sublime; small, playful waterfalls, white sandy beaches and dramatic mountain views are just a sliver of the hidden treasures Udor has to offer, which is why the country is favored among foreigners.
The people of Udor are reserved towards foreigners and tend to welcome them with sarcasm. They feel foreigners could sabotage the country's well being.
Udor has humane laws and law enforcement, which is to be expected. The people are angered due to infertile lands, caused by irrational fears and superstitions.
This is also reflected in the country's flag, which has two vertical stripes and a circle in light silver, dark bronze, white and dark orange. Their coat of arms is an important spiritual symbol surrounded by sun rays
