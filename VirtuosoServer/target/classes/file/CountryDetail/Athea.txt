The country of Athea is a little country with a population of 772398 humans
Bordered between huge mountains to the North, fertile grounds to the South, a volcano to the East and large rock formations to the West, the country of Athea mainly lives off crafting, alchemy and herbalism.
Athea itself is mainly covered in wastelands and has a temperate climate, which has lead to a loosely concentrated population, despite the number of people, which means most of them live in small settlements.
The country's landscape is depressing; dry, barren fields, rocky beaches and dangerous mountains are just a sliver of the solitude Athea has to offer, which is why the country is infamous among foreigners.
The people of Athea are welcoming towards foreigners and tend to welcome them with a place to stay. They feel foreigners could further finance the country's well being.
Athea has moderate laws and law enforcement, which is to be expected. The people are distressed due to ferocious wildlife, caused by unfortunate natural properties.
This is also reflected in the country's flag, which has the country's outline on a background in dark brown, gold and dark orange. Their coat of arms is a skull surrounded by stripes
