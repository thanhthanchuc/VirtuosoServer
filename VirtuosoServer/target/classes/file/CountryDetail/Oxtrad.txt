The country of Oxtrad is an enormous country with a population of 9126085 high elves
Bordered between a canal to the North, huge, open plains to the South, large rock formations to the East and a tall mountain range to the West, the country of Oxtrad mainly lives off wood production, animal training and tailoring.
Oxtrad itself is mainly covered in jungles and has a calm climate, which has lead to a fairly centered population, despite the number of people, which means most of them live in megalopolises.
The country's landscape is grisly; steep, sinister mountains, fiercy rock formations and creepy, aquatic wildlife are just a sliver of the brusqueness Oxtrad has to offer, which is why the country is rejected among foreigners.
The people of Oxtrad are supportive towards foreigners and tend to welcome them with drinks. They feel foreigners could augment the country's well being.
Oxtrad has mild laws and law enforcement, which is quite normal. The people are concerend due to distressed nature and wildlife, caused by a struggling economy.
This is also reflected in the country's flag, which has the country's outline on a background in white, blue and light purple. Their coat of arms is a bird's claw on top of a hill
