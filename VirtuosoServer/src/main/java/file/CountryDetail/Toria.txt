The country of Toria is a modest country with a population of 466500 blood elves
Bordered between a stone wall to the North, a huge mountain to the South, large mountains to the East and large rock formations to the West, the country of Toria mainly lives off crafting, mining and woodcrafting.
Toria itself is mainly covered in caves and has a hot climate, which has lead to a loosely concentrated population, despite the number of people, which means most of them live in townships.
The country's landscape is delicate; small, playful waterfalls, dramatic mountain views and imposing fjords are just a sliver of the delicacy Toria has to offer, which is why the country is favored among foreigners.
The people of Toria are ill-tempered towards foreigners and tend to welcome them with bitterness. They feel foreigners could deface the country's well being.
Toria has firm laws and law enforcement, which is quite normal. The people are restless due to declining neighbor relations, caused by greed.
This is also reflected in the country's flag, which has a cross on a background in dark grey, black, dark orange and brown. Their coat of arms are two dragonteeth on a hexagon
