The country of Ashia is an enormous country with a population of 11762823 halflings
Bordered between mineral rich mountains to the North, a small mountain range to the South, a stone wall to the East and a river to the West, the country of Ashia mainly lives off trade, mining and leatherworking.
Ashia itself is mainly covered in frozen lands and has a stormy climate, which has lead to a dispersed population, despite the number of people, which means most of them live in tiny villages.
The country's landscape is quite frightening; wild, overgrown forests, steep, sinister mountains and rocky beaches are just a sliver of the misery Ashia has to offer, which is why the country is an infamous destination among foreigners.
The people of Ashia are unwelcoming towards foreigners and tend to welcome them with annoyance. They feel foreigners could butcher the country's well being.
Ashia has moderate laws and law enforcement, which is what you'd expect. The people are distressed due to a lack of skilled craftsmen, caused by old superstitions.
This is also reflected in the country's flag, which has an outlined cross dividing a background in 4 triangular parts in dark orange, silver, white and light red. Their coat of arms are three fish with two keys on either side
