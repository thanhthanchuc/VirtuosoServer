The country of Osium is an enormous country with a population of 3169128 dark elves
Bordered between highlands to the North, rough beaches to the South, a small ocean to the East and a swampland to the West, the country of Osium mainly lives off animal training, animal breeding and beer brewing.
Osium itself is mainly covered in tall forests and has a rainy climate, which has lead to a dispersed population, despite the number of people, which means most of them live in small towns.
The country's landscape is beautiful; mellow rivers, half frozen rivers and mellow rivers are just a sliver of the appeal Osium has to offer, which is why the country is a popular destination among foreigners.
The people of Osium are unwelcoming towards foreigners and tend to welcome them with indifference. They feel foreigners could slow down the country's well being.

This is also reflected in the country's flag, which has two vertical stripes in light yellow and grey. Their coat of arms is a dog on top of a wave
