The country of Ogria is a large country with a population of 10917617 dwarves
Bordered between fjords to the North, a stone wall to the South, a bamboo forest to the East and a sea to the West, the country of Ogria mainly lives off thieving, carpenting and engineering.
Ogria itself is mainly covered in rich woodlands and has a wet climate, which has lead to a thinly spread population, despite the number of people, which means most of them live in small towns.
The country's landscape is dark; somber hills, desolate grasslands and somber architecture are just a sliver of the crudity Ogria has to offer, which is why the country is a shunned destination among foreigners.
The people of Ogria are sociable towards foreigners and tend to welcome them with a feast. They feel foreigners could promote the country's well being.
Ogria has gentle laws and law enforcement, which is fairly normal. The people are unbalanced due to a decreasing population, caused by greed.
This is also reflected in the country's flag, which has two vertical stripes and a circle in light bronze, dark gold, silver, light brown and dark purple. Their coat of arms is a sea monster on top of a hill
