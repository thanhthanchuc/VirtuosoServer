The country of Omen is a small country with a population of 391592 trolls
Bordered between a huge sea to the North, rich forests to the South, fjords to the East and large mountains to the West, the country of Omen mainly lives off animal breeding, jewelcrafting and weaponsmithing.
Omen itself is mainly covered in caves and has a humid climate, which has lead to a congested population, despite the number of people, which means most of them live in big cities.
The country's landscape is uninviting; fiercy rock formations, withered flower fields and destructive waterfalls are just a sliver of the dangers Omen has to offer, which is why the country is shunned among foreigners.
The people of Omen are unreceptive towards foreigners and tend to welcome them with displeasure. They feel foreigners could block the country's well being.
Omen has tight laws and law enforcement, which is normal for their situation. The people are anquished due to lack of freedom, caused by sticking to outdated traditions.
This is also reflected in the country's flag, which has a moon and two stars on a background in pink, dark red and light gold. Their coat of arms is a cat on top of two stripes
