The country of Emain is a tiny country with a population of 822569 giants
Bordered between a calm ocean to the North, a huge sea to the South, fertile grounds to the East and a calm river to the West, the country of Emain mainly lives off jewelcrafting, leatherworking and farming.
Emain itself is mainly covered in uninhabitable mountains and has a rainy climate, which has lead to a packed population, despite the number of people, which means most of them live in big settlements.
The country's landscape is unsightly; withered flower fields, somber hills and smelly, overgrown ponds are just a sliver of the barrenness Emain has to offer, which is why the country is shirked among foreigners.
The people of Emain are unpleasant towards foreigners and tend to welcome them with turned backs. They feel foreigners could interfere with the country's well being.
